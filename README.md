## Disclaimer

This project is currently in development and **not intended for production use** yet. Our goal is to organize and refine it before making it production-ready. We welcome and encourage contributors to join us in improving the code.

> **Note:** At this stage, Bards Database is more of a rough concept than a fully functional application. It serves as a proof of concept and is still undergoing design and implementation improvements.

## Features

- User Authentication
- User Management
- Database Management
- Data Visualization
- Data Export & Import
- Data Backup
- Third-Party API Integration
- Plugin Support
- Customizable Dashboard & Interface
- Customizable Database Schema & Data Types
- Integration with Other Tools and Services

We drew inspiration from platforms like Firebase, Supabase, and Pocketbase for the API design and dashboard functionality. The backend is built using **Next.js** and **TypeScript** with a custom **Express** server.

We plan to use **Docker Compose** to create instances for both the web UI and MongoDB database, which will handle user authentication.

### Future Plans

We aim to implement multi-tenant support and additional features over time.
